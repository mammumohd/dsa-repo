# Delete Operation in Max heap

In heap we only delete root element

1. Max heap at present 

 ```
           50
         /   \
        30     20
       / \    / \ 
    15   10  8   16

 ```

    [50,30,20,15,10,8,16]

2. Deleting 50

 ```
          empty
         /   \
        30     20
       / \    / \ 
    15   10  8   16

 ```

    ['',30,20,15,10,8,16]

3. We need to preserve complete binary tree property

 **a. Last element in complete binary tree will come in roots place**  

 ```
          16
         /   \
        30     20
       / \    / \ 
    15   10  8   16

 ```

    [16,30,20,15,10,8,'']

 **b.Now we Adjust element to balance**

   Compare the children and swap with greatest one

    30 > 16

  ```  

           30
         /   \
        16     20
       / \    /  
    15   10  8

  ```

    [30,16,20,15,10,8,'']

    16 > 15 and 16 > 10

    No more swap needed 


3. We remove root , repalce root with last element , adjust or balance the tree


Time complexity 

max time is dependant on height -> O (log n)
