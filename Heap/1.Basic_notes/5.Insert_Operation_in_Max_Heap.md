# Insert operation in max heap

1. Max heap at present 

```
           50
         /   \
        30     20
       / \    / \ 
      15   10  8   16

```

    [50,30,20,15,10,8,16]

2. we are trying to insert 60 in to the max heap , so we add it in left most position possible

 ```
           50
         /   \
        30     20
       / \    / \ 
    15   10  8   16  
   /
  60

 ```
    
  [50,30,20,15,10,8,16,60]

3. Find the parent , if array starts from 0  -> floor( (i-1) /2)  , else floor( i/2 )

   here index 7 has 60 starting from 0 

   7-1/2 = 6/2 = 3

   parent is at index 3 = 15

   compare with 60 with 15 if greater swap

  ```

                      50
                    /   \
                   30     20
                  / \    / \ 
               60   10  8   16  
              /
             15
  ```
    
  [50,30,20,60,10,8,16,15]

  repeat

    3-1/2 = 2/2 =  1
```
                      50
                    /   \
                   60     20
                  / \    / \ 
               30   10  8   16  
              /
             15

```
    
  [50,60,20,30,10,8,16,15]


  repeat 

  1-1/2 = 0/2 = 0

```
                      60
                    /   \
                   50     20
                  / \    / \ 
               30   10  8   16  
              /
             15
```
    
  [60,50,20,30,10,8,16,15]


# Time Complexity

here we had to traverse the height of the tree , i.e, the Insert Operation took = ciel(log(n+1)-1)
which in case of complete binary tree translates to  floor( log2 (n) )

O(log n) is the complexity for insertion


Minimum when there is no swap required is O(1)

**insertion time varies from  O(1) -> O (log n)** 

Direction of adjustment ->  Leaf to root
