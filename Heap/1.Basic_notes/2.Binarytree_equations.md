# Equations



**1. Formula for Max number of nodes in a tree given height 'h'**

 Max number of nodes = 2^(h+1) - 1


**Height :**

1. Calculating minimum height  and maximum height from number of nodes in binary tree

Minimum height (balanced tree - Lower bound): 

    ```
        floor( log2(n) )...if you know n is a power of 2 (like 4 , 8 etc)

        in general 

        ceil( log2(n+1) ) - 1 


    ```

Proof:
    
    ```

    A tree with a height (or depth) of  h has at most the following number of nodes.

    i.e ,
               h   i
        n <=  ∑   2   =  2^ (h+1) - 1
               𝑖=0  
        
        h + 1 <= log 2 (n+1)

        h <= log2 (n+1) -1

        ceil( log2(n+1) ) - 1 

    ```

Maximum Height (Unbalance tree - upper bound): 

    ```
        n-1
    ```
