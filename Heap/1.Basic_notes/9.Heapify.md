# Heapify

- When we created heap earlier , we went in ( leap -> root )
- Now we can create heap from ( root -> leaf ) , that is called heapify

Heapify is a procedure for creating a heap

 ```
           10
         /   \
        20    15
       / \   / \ 
     12  40 25  18

```
    [10,20,15,12,40,25,18] 

1. In heapify if we are given elements such as this , we focus on going from right to left 

2. We look at 18 

    18 is a heap , it has no childrens

3. We look at 25

    25 is a heap , it has no childrens

4. We look at 40

    40 is a heap , it has no childrens

5. We look at 12

    12 is a heap , it has no childrens

6. We look at 15 , it has children , so adjust downwards

    25 > 18 > 15 

  ```
           10
         /   \
        20    25
       / \   / \ 
     12  40 15  18

  ```

    [10,20,25,12,40,15,18]

7. We look at 20, it has children, so adjust downwards

    40 > 20 > 12 

   ```
           10
         /   \
        40    25
       / \   / \ 
     12  20 15  18

   ```

    [10,40,25,12,20,15,18]

8. We look at 10, it has children, so adjust downwards

    40 > 25 > 10  

   ```
           40
         /   \
        10    25
       / \   / \ 
     12  20 15  18

   ```

    [40,10,25,12,20,15,18]


    20 > 12 > 10  

   ```

           40
         /   \
        20    25
       / \   / \ 
     12  10 15  18

   ```

    [40,20,25,12,10,15,18]


    Time take is O(n)

    Creating a heap -> O (n log n)
    Heapify -> O (n)
