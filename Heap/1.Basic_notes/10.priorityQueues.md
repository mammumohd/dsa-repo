# Priority Queue

- it not the normal FIFO
- Elements are inserted based on priority
- While deleting highest priority one is deleted first
 

In min heap :

           3     -------- 0
         /   \
        5     4   -------- 1
       / \   / \ 
      10  8 6   9 -------- 2 (height)

Lower the number higher the priority


In max heap :

           10     -------- 0
         /   \
        8     9   -------- 1
       / \   / \ 
      6   5 3   4 -------- 2 (height)

Higher the number higher the priority


If you implement priority queue using an array , it would take :

    Insertion may take O(n) , and may be deletion is faster ( for 1 element )

    Deletion  may take O(n) , and may be insertion is faster ( for 1 element )


**But if we implement it using Heap , then it would take** 
 
**O(log n) - for insertion 1 elementand**
**O(log n) - for deletion 1 element**

 
 thus heap is the best data structure for Priority Queue
