# Representation of Binary Tree 

           A
         /   \
        B     C
       / \   / \ 
      D   E F   G

 ## Array Implementation

    We can represent a binary tree as a array. we can start filing it from index 0 or index 1
    
    **Case 1: index (0 —> n-1)** 

    [A,B,C,D,E,F,G]   ( From index 0 )
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6

    if (say)father is at index = i; 
    **then left_son= (2*i) + 1;** 
    **and right_son= (2*i) + 2;**

    **The parent of node i can be found at position floor ( (i – 1) / 2 )**
    
    **Case 2: index ( 1 —> n )**

    [ ,A,B,C,D,E,F,G] ( From index 1 )
     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

    if (say)father= i; 
    **then left_son= (2*i);** 
    **and right_son= (2*i) + 1;**

    **The parent of node i can be found at position floor ( (i) / 2 )** 


           A
         /   \
        B     C
       / \   / \ 
             F   G

    This tree would be represented as [A,B,C, , ,F,G]
