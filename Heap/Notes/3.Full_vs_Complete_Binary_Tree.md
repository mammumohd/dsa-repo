# 1. Full Binary Tree

            A     -------- 0
         /   \
        B     C   -------- 1
       / \   / \ 
      D   E F   G -------- 2 (height)

    Here height of binary tree is 2 
    When a trees height is full and no new node can be added in to its max height its called Full Binary tree
    here in this tree the height level is 2 and no node can be added more to level 2 , its full 

    **in short , A binary tree with maximum number of node ( 2^(h+1) - 1 ) is Full Binary tree**
    **in an array representation there will be no spaces**

    **Every Full binary tree is a complete Binary tree**

# 2. Complete Binary Tree


            A     -------- 0
         /   \
        B     C   -------- 1
       / \     
      D   E       -------- 2 (height)


    Every Full binary tree is complete binary tree

    In a complete binary tree of height h  is a full binary tree till level h-1
    in the last level elements are filled from left to right 

    You will not get gaps just like full binary tree

    `Height of complete binary tree is logs (n)`

    proof: 

     ```
          Given: n = 8 (number of nodes)

          Step 1: Calculate the height using the formula
          Height = ceil(log₂(n+1)) - 1

          Step 2: Substitute the value of n into the formula
          Height = ceil(log₂(8+1)) - 1
          Height = ceil(log₂(9)) - 1

          Step 3: Calculate the logarithm base 2 of 9
          Height = ceil(3.169925) - 1

          Step 4: Round up to the nearest integer
          Height = 4 - 1

          Step 5: Calculate the final height
          Height = 3

     ```
