# Heap Sort

Continuing from the note 6


1. Now we have deleted 50 and we have space in our array representation 

   [30,16,20,15,10,8,'']


   if we choose to we can keep the last delted element in that empty space 

   [30,16,20,15,10,8,50]

   it out of heap , its not part of heap , heap size is 6 


   Current heap 


           30
         /   \
        16     20
       / \    /  
    15   10  8    

    [30,16,20,15,10,8,50(del)]

2. I will not delete 30 and will back it up in empty space in place of 8


           20
         /   \
        16     8
       / \      
    15   10     

    [20,16,8,15,10,30(d),50(d)] 

    Heap size is 5 , last deleted element 30


Now If kepp deleting 

   next element deleted 
    20
    16
    ...

each time next largest is deleted 

finally we will have  [8,10,15,16,20,30,50]

This is sorted  


**If you have a heap , delete the element and fill it in empty space after deletion
