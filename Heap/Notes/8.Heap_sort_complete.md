# Complete Heap Sort

Heap sort have 2 steps

1. Given set of elements  **Create a heap** by inserting elements one by one 
2. Once the heap is formed,  **Delete the elements from the heap** one by one



# 1. Create

1. Given [10,20,15,30,40]

2. we assume first element is already in a heap 

Heap : 

        10

3.  insert 20 

     10                                      
    /      
   20   

   compare 20  is greater than 10  (1-1)/2 = 0 is parent 
 
    20
   /
  10
  
   [20,10,'','','']

4. Insert 15

   [20,10,15,'','']

   parent = 2-1/2 = 1/2 = 0.5 = 0

   15 < 20

    20
   /  \
  10   15


5. insert 30

   [20,10,15,30,'']

   parent = 3-1/2 = 2/2 = 1

   35 > 10

   swap -> [20,30,15,10,'']

   parent = 1-1/2 = 0 

   30 > 20

   swap -> [30,20,15,10,'']

     30
    /  \
   20   15
  /
 10

6. insert 40 

   [30,20,15,10,40]

   parent = 4-1/2 = 3/2 = 1.5 = 1

   40 > 20

   swap -> [30,40,15,10,20]

   parent = 1-1/2 = 0 

   40 > 30

   swap -> [40,30,15,10,20]

     40
    /  \
   30   15
  /  \
 10  20

 Time complexity -> depends on height 

 we inserted n elements  for 1 element is o(logn)

 i.e, time complexity = O (n log n)



# 2. Delete

initial  [40,30,15,10,20]

1. delete 40 

[30,20,15,10,40(d)]

     30
    /  \
   20   15
  /  
 10  

2. delete 30 

[20,10,15,30(d),40(d)]

     20
    /  \
   10   15

3. delete 20 

[15,10,20(d),30(d),40(d)]

     15
    /  
   10 

4. delete 15

[10,15(d),20(d),30(d),40(d)]

    10  

5. delete 10

[10(d),15(d),20(d),30(d),40(d)]



Sorted :) 


TIme complexity: for 1 deletion o (log n)

for n , O (n logn )




For creation and deletion 

O (n logn ) + O (n logn ) =  2 O (n logn ) = O (n logn )
