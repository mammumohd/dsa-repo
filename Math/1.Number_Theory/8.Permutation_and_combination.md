# Permutation and Combination


## Permutations:

A permutation is an arrangement of objects in a specific order.
The number of permutations of n distinct objects taken r at a time is given by 

nPr = n! / (n - r)!.

    Arranging Books on a Shelf

    Suppose we have 7 different books that we want to arrange on a shelf.

    We have 7 distinct books, so n = 7.
    Let's say we want to arrange 4 books on the shelf, so r = 4.
    Using the permutation formula:

    npr  

```


## Combinations:

A combination is a selection of objects without considering the order.
The number of combinations of n distinct objects taken r at a time is given by 

nCr = n! / (r! * (n - r)!).


Example 1: Choosing a Committee

Suppose we have a group of 6 people, and we want to form a committee of 3 people.

We have 6 distinct people, so n = 6.
We want to choose 3 people for the committee, so r = 3.

Using the combination formula nCr = n! / (r! * (n - r)!):
