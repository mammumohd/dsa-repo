# LCM - Lowest Common Multiple

Smallest number other than zero, that is a multiple of each no

LCM of 4 and 6 

4: 4 8 12 16 20
6: 6 12 18

12 is the LCM 

  # Naive solution:
      
      Find max in both a and b , from max iterate until condition is satisfied such that a number divides both the given item evenly 

      function LCM(a,b) {
        var res = Math.max(a,b)

        while(true) {
            if(a%res ==0 && b%res == 0) {
                return res;
            }
            res+=1
        }
      }

      o ( a * b - max(a,b) )

   # Efficient solution

   function LCM(a,b) {
        var lcm = a * b / gcd(a,b)
    }
