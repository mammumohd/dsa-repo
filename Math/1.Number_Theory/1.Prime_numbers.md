# Prime Numbers

- Prime number is a number that is only divisible by  1 and itself

- Prime number are represented by ( 6n + 1 ) , ( 6n - 1 ) , except 2 and 3
- 2, 3, 5 (6 * 1 - 1), 7 (6 * 1 + 1), 11 (6 * 2 - 1), 13 (6 * 2 + 1)

- Every positive Integer an be decomposed in to a product of primes
  eg: 84 = 2^2 * 3^1 * 5^0 * 7^1 * 11^0 * 13^0 * 17^0 ..........
  note: Many of the prime numbers have an exponent of zero 

## divisibility

  1. In order for a number 'x' to divide a number 'y' mod(y,x) = 0
     all primes in x's primefactorization must be present in y's prime factorization

    ```
     x = 2 ^ j0 * 3 ^ j1 * 4 ^ j2 ...
     y = 2 ^ k0 * 3 ^ k1 * 4 ^ k2 ...

     if x/y , then for i  ji <= ki

    ```

    `Infact , Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of x and y will be`

    ```
        gcd(x,y) = 2 ^ min(j0,k0) * 3 ^ min(j1,k1) * 5 ^ min(j2,k2) ...  

    ```

    `Infact , Least Common Multiple (LCM) of x and y will be`

    ```
        lcm(x,y) = 2 ^ max(j0,k0) * 3 ^ max(j1,k1) * 5 ^ max(j2,k2) ...  

    ```

    Interestingly then 

    gcd * lcm = xy
