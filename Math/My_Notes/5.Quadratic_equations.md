# Qudratic Equations

A quadratic equation will look like the following 

` a x^2 + bx + c = 0 `

root of the equation - Value of x for which the condition satisfies  , There can be max `2` root for an quadratic equation

Descriminant , ` D = b^2 - 4 * a * c ` 

root , x = ( -b +- sqrt(b^2 - 4 * a* c) ) / 2 * a

D < 0 , imaginary roots 
D =0  , equal roots 
D > 0 , 2 distinct roots
