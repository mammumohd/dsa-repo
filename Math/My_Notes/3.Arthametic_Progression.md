# Arthametic progression Sum

progression: a , a+d ,a+2d , a+3d , a+4d, ..... , a+ (n-1) d

# Equation

`SUM = n/2 ( 2a+ (n-1)d )`

# Proof

```

Average for evenly spaced items  = ( first + last ) / 2

Average gernerally = Sum / n

i.e,  Sum  = n * Average

Sum =  n * ( first + last ) / 2

Sum = n/2 * (a + a + (n-1) d )

Sum = n/2 ( 2a+ (n-1)d )
