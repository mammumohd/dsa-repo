```

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [24,12,8,6]
Example 2:

Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

### LC link : https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-self/

### Level: Medium

### Pattern found :  2 pass / ( variation on 2 pointer in  away , or a variation on Divisors of a number )

### Thoughts:

The naive solution I thought was about dividing, but the question said not ( You should read the question completely )

The I got tied up thinking about a 2 pointer system but Than would not give me O(n)

So then I relaised it was a 2 pass thing , but needed help to understand

basially , one pass1 we fill the result array with product of prefixes 
on second pass from end to satrt we fill it with product of post fixes 

pre and post out of bounds are assumed to be 1 ( you will know from example)


```

given nums = [1,2,3,4]

answer = []

naive:
1 -> 2 3 4 -> 24
2 -> 1 3 4 -> 12
3 -> 1 3 4 -> 8
4 -> 1 2 3 -> 6

we do 2 passes 
pass 1-> we store the prefix in the result Array for each number we see , for first number it will be on 

for 1,2,3,4 , after pass 1

pre=1
[1,,,] , pre = 1 * 1

pre= 1
[1,1,,] , pre = 1 * 2

pre=2
[1,1,2,] , pre = 2 * 3

pre = 6
[1,1,2,6] , pre = 6 * 4 (24)


pass 2 -> for every number we see we multiple the prefix in its position 


post=1
[1,1,2,6] , post = 1 * 4 = 4

post=4
[1,1,8,6] , pre =  4 * 3 = 12

post=12
[1,24,8,6] , pre =  12 * 2 = 24

post=24
[24,24,8,6] , pre =  24 * 1 = 24

*/

var productExceptSelf = function(nums) {

    var resultArray = new Array(nums.length)
    var pre = 1
    for( var index=0; index < nums.length; index++) {
        resultArray[index] = pre
        pre *= nums[index]
    }

    var post = 1
    index -= 1

    for( ; index >= 0; index--) {
        resultArray[index] *= post
        post *= nums[index]
    }

    return resultArray
    
};
